## Wrapping up

What we learned with this tutorial:
* What is Ansible?
* What is the MERN stack?
* What are Playbooks and how can they be used to automating the setup of a MERN stack?

You can use it to set it up for your local development environment. 
But remember that the true power of Ansible reveals itself when you deploy it to multiple servers at the same time.
