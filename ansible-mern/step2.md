The top tier of MERN is React, a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. The next level down is the Express server-side framework, which supports many middlewares, making it simpler and easier to write the back-end code. Node.js, outside Express, provides a JavaScript Environment. The bottom layer is MongoDB, a NoSQL database where each record is a document consisting of key-value pairs similar to JSON Objects.

MERN stack becomes very popular these days, especially for startups. The main reason for this is that MERN is very easy to use and allows you to build applications fast. The whole stack uses JavaScript meaning that you don't need to learn any other languages. And all the components of MERN are open source, constantly improved by experts from all around the world and with great community support. You can find detailed documentation, tutorials, and templates online, which means you don't need to build from scratch.
